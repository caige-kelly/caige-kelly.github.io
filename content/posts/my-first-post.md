This is my first blog post and I have a few ideas of what I want to write about in a constructive manner. But I will start off with a recent experience to get a post out before I ultimately never write one.

I listen to a lot of talks on YouTube from sources such as GOTO describing the state of IT, The state of Agile, and the general shortcomings of current enterprises. But the issue I have developed with these talks personally is they are for developers. I have listened to people such as Dan North, James Coplien, Allen Holub, and Dave Farley for a few years now and as primarily an operations person working in a typical enterprise these talks and insights have brought me nothing but misery.

But why is the question. 

The answer and my eventual acceptance have hit me like a 100-pound hammer...most people don't care. Most people want to go to work, complete the tickets that are assigned to them and go home. I envy these people greatly. I tend to be a job hopper. Every time I join an organization, I tell myself I will only do what is asked of me, do the best job I can and go home. But I fail every single time. Maybe it can be called entitlement as a somewhat younger person turning 30. But ultimately, I refuse to do stupid things. It doesnâ€™t feel like entitlement. It feels like thinking. 

I was recently turned down for an ansible gig. It was a contract role with decent pay. The interview from a technical perspective was easy enough, ansible is an easy tool. But during the interview I made the critical mistake of expressing thoughts past writing ansible playbooks. Over the past year or so I have come to despise "Agile" and "scrum", or what it has become. So, during this interview I asked the interviewers, "Do you think scrum works?". As they said they were also 'scumming'. Their response was, "Yes, when people follow it" and "It tells you who is and isn't working". I knew there I didn't want the job, expect maybe for the pay. This is mostly my fault. Contract work is a game of pimps and hos, as a good friend of mine has put it, and I didn't have the right mindset going into that interview. 

One curious thing I have noticed since joining scrum teams, I don't have to submit timecards anymore. Has anyone else noticed this?
