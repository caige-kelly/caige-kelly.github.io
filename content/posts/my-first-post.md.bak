This is my first blog post and I have a few ideas of what I want to write about in a 
constructive manner. But I will start of with a recent experience to get a post out
before I ultimelty never write one.


I listen to a lot of talks on YouTube from sources such as GOTO describing the state of IT,
The state of Agile, and the general short commings of current enterprises today. But the issue I 
have developed with these talks personally are they are for developers. I have listened to 
people such as Dan North, James Coplien, Allen Holub, and Dave Farley for a few years now
and as primarily a operations person it has brought me nothing but misery.

But, Why is the question. 

This answer hit me like a 100 pound hammer...the vast majority of people don't care.
Most people want to come in, do the tickets that are assigned to them and go home a five.
I envy these people greatly. I tend to be job hopper. Everytime I join an organization
I tell myself I will only do what is asked of, do the best job I can of what is asked
and go home. But I fail every single time. Maybe it can be called entitlement as a some what
young person turning 30. Ultimatly, I refuse to do stupid things. I don't think that's
entitlement. To me that's called thinking. 

I was recently turned down for an ansible gig. It was a contract role with decent pay. The
interview from a techinical perspective went well, ansible is an easy tool. But during 
the interview I made the critical mistake of expressing thought past writing ansible
playbooks. Over the past year or so I have come to despise "Agile" and "scrum", or what
it has become. So during this interview I asked the interviewers, "Do you think scrum works".
As they said they were also 'scumming'. Their response was, "Yes, when people follow it" and,
"It tells you who is and isn't working". I knew there I didn't want the job. This is mostly
my fault. Contract work is a game of pimps and hos and I didn't have the right mindset going
into that interview.

One curious thing I have noticed when I am on a scrum team I don't have to submit time cards
anymore. Has anyone else noticed this?
